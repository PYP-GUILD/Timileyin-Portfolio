# Timileyin — Student Portfolio

This is a small, responsive static portfolio scaffold created from the user's resume/spec.

What’s included
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html`
- `css/styles.css` — mobile-first responsive styles
- `js/main.js` — small JS for nav toggle and contact mailto fallback
- `images/` — SVG placeholders for profile and projects

Preview locally
1. Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step required.

Replace content
- Replace the SVGs in `images/` with your real `profile.jpg` and project screenshots. Update image file names in the HTML if needed.
- Edit the text in the HTML files to match your biography, education, and project descriptions.

Deploy
- GitHub Pages: push this repository to GitHub and enable Pages from the `main` (or `gh-pages`) branch. Optionally use the provided GitHub Actions workflow to publish to `gh-pages`.

Next steps I can do for you
- Add a polished CSS theme or use Tailwind.
- Add form handling with Formspree/Netlify.
- Wire up CI/CD and automatic deploy to GitHub Pages.
